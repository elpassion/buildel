## Introduction
[Buildel](https://buildel.ai/) is a platform designed to empower users to create versatile and dynamic workflows tailored to their specific needs. 
With an intuitive, modular approach, Buildel allows you to assemble workflows from a variety of blocks, including text input/output, chat interfaces, document search capabilities, and API-call tools, among others. 

This flexibility makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, from AI-powered document retrieval systems and sophisticated conversational interfaces to complex data integration frameworks.

## Features 

* ðŸ”€ Multiple Providers - We support multiple providers for the same type of block. Use OpenAI, Google, Mistral and many more.
* ðŸ’» Different Interfaces - You can build different interfaces for the same workflow. Use chat, api, or any other interface.
* ðŸ“– Open Source - Buildel is open source. You can host it for free on your own and contribute to it.
* ðŸš€ Pre-built Use Cases - We have pre-built use cases that you can use to get started quickly.
* ðŸ§© No Code Required - You don't need to write a single line of code. Just pick and connect the blocks and you are good to go.
* ðŸ”‘ Bring Your Own Keys - You can use your own API keys for the blocks that need them.


## Examples 
Below are examples of workflows you can create to enhance your projects with dynamic, AI-powered solutions:

#### Memory

This setup is an AI-powered document retrieval system that can understand natural language queries and provide precise, contextually relevant information from a vast repository of documents.

</p>

Ideal for customer support, research, and educational purposes, this workflow simplifies complex search tasks into an intuitive chat experience.

#### Multiple Models

This configuration is designed for creating a highly efficient, AI-driven conversational system where a primary chat block (leader) intelligently delegates specific tasks to a secondary chat module.

</p>

#### Api call tools

This advanced workflow configuration is tailored for implementing a powerful, AI-guided system capable of executing diverse HTTP operations via multiple API-call tools, each uniquely configured for specific tasks.

</p>

The ingenuity of this setup lies in the leader chat's ability to dynamically interact with a suite of API-call tools based on the context and requirements of user queries.
